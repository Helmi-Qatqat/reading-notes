### An introduction to NodeJS and Express

**Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.**
- The middleware a JavaScript function that can access the request and response and do a process on them.

**Express the most popular __ __ ____.**
- Nodejs framework.

**Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?**
- It allows developers the freedom to structure their code how they choose instead of forcing a particular code structure.

**What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?**
- A module is a file containing related code that can be imported and exported to share and receive functionalities across different modules, because it allows us to break our code into separate files making it easier for us to debug and track our code.

### What is NPM?

**What version of npm are you running on your machine?**
- v18.15.0

**What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?**
- npm install jshint

### What is TDD?

**Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.**
- As programmers most of the times we know what the result will be and based on that we write our code, so inorder to know weither our code is giving the desired output, we test it, and the output of that test can be either pass or fail, it is important inorder to get a simple bug-free code. 

**What are three expected benefits of testing**
1. Bug-free code.
2. Insure that the output of the code is identical to the desired output.
3. Prevent pull requests that have errors in them.

**Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.**
**Individual pitfalls:**

1. Lack of attention to detail: Writing tests requires a high level of attention to detail. If an individual is not careful, they may miss important details that could lead to bugs in the code.

2. Lack of communication: Testers need to communicate effectively with developers and other stakeholders to ensure that everyone is on the same page. If an individual fails to communicate effectively, it can lead to misunderstandings and mistakes.

**Team pitfalls:**

1. Lack of collaboration: Testing is a team effort, and it’s important for everyone on the team to work together effectively. If team members don’t collaborate effectively, it can lead to inefficiencies and mistakes.

2. Lack of planning: Testing requires careful planning to ensure that all aspects of the code are tested thoroughly. If a team fails to plan effectively, they may miss important tests or fail to allocate enough time for testing.

### CI/CD

**What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?**
- Ensures each dev is working within the most up to date branch.
- Helps to catch bugs at their onset, versus waiting to merge later in development and having to run down bugs without knowing when they were introduced.
- Reduce merge conflicts.

**What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?**
- Continuous delivery is a process where an application is developed to be released at any time, on the other hand continuous deployment is a process where new features can be deployed immediately.

**Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background**
- GitHub provides a centralized location that allows software developers to contribute to a code repository by incorporating the CI/CD process.

**How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?** 
- JavaScript is a language  made specifically for web interactivity, but this language can be only used in browser, so developers came up of an idea of making JavaScript accessible outside the browser, to be precise, for servers.

**What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?**
- It is the hardware and software infrastructure that supports the running of a particular codebase in real time.

**What is Node used for?**
- Node is used for the backend side.
