# Linked Lists

**What is data structures?**
- They are the differant ways we organized our data.

**What is linked lists?**
- It is a type of data structure that has nodes linked to another values, linked lists are categorized as linear data structure.

**What do we call the first and last nodes in a linked list?**
- The first node is called 'Head', on the other hand the last node is called the tail.

**How are the nodes linked to each other?**
- Each node has an indicator to what their next node value is.

**How do we know the end of a linked list?**
- When the current node is pointing to null, meaning that there is no next node and therefore the node is the last.

**What are the types of linked lists?**
- Single (linear) linked list.
- Doubly linked list.
- Circular linked list.

**What are the differances between each type?**
- Each node in a single linked list know what the next node is, in doubly linked list each node can also know the previous node, on the other hand circular's linked list tail next node points to the head unlike single linked list and doubly linked list tails next node points to null.
