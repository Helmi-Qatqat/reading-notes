# Event Driven Programming

**What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?**

-  EventEmitter.

**What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?**

- integrating OOP with EDP brings advantages such as modularity, code organization, maintainability, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, scalability, and flexibility. These synergistic approaches enable developers to build robust, extensible, and maintainable software systems.

**Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.**

- Event-driven programming in the backend using Node.js can be beneficial because it allows for efficient handling of concurrent tasks. With event-driven programming, the application can respond to various events or triggers, such as incoming requests or data changes, without blocking the execution of other tasks. This asynchronous nature of event-driven programming helps enhance the scalability and responsiveness of server applications.
